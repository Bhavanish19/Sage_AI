# 🚀 Sage AI an AI Agent that Answers Question in Real-time 

## Overview

This project an AI chat application built using Next.js 15, React 19, Convex, Clerk, and LangChain. The app leverages Anthropic Claude 3.5 for intelligent responses and integrates ConvexDB for real-time chat storage. It includes Anthropic, tool orchestration with IBM's wxflows, sophisticated AI state management using LangChain and LangGraph, and a modern real-time chat UI in Next.js 15. The application is deployed to Vercel with production-ready configurations and optimized token usage.

## 🔥 Features

### ✅ Authentication: Seamless authentication powered by Clerk.


### ✅ Real-time Chat: Messages are streamed and stored efficiently using Convex.


### ✅ AI Assistant: Integrated with LangChain & LangGraph and Anthropic Claude 3.5 for intelligent agent responses.


### ✅ Modern UI: Built with ShadCN, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI for a sleek and responsive interface.


### ✅ Fast and Scalable: Utilizes Next.js App Router and Edge Functions for performance.


### ✅ Advanced AI Tool Orchestration with LangChain & LangGraph


### ✅ Deployment to Production with Vercel
